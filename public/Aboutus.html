    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>
        Milkylush is more than just a milk delivery service — we are a movement towards a healthier, cleaner, and more sustainable way of living. Based on the simple idea of providing fresh, unprocessed, and plastic-free milk, we’ve grown into a trusted name for families seeking purity and quality.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
       We are a group of passionate students and co-founders of Milky Lush, who embarked on this journey driven by a simple but powerful realization—the hidden dangers of plastic-packed milk. As young individuals concerned about health and the environment, we discovered how plastic packaging can affect the purity of milk and contribute to growing pollution.

Determined to make a change, we introduced a fresh approach: delivering milk in reusable glass bottles. This not only preserves the milk’s natural goodness but also helps reduce plastic waste—protecting both your health and our planet.

At Milky Lush, we proudly follow the traditional method of milk consumption passed down through generations. Instead of heavily processing or pasteurizing, we keep our milk as natural as possible, retaining all the essential nutrients and rich flavor that modern processing often diminishes.

Our mission is simple—to bring you pure, fresh, and nutrient-rich milk the way it was meant to be enjoyed, while caring deeply for the environment and supporting sustainable living.

Join us in this journey toward healthier choices and a cleaner future—one glass bottle of milk at a time.
